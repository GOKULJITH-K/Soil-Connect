## Short description

### What's the problem?

Manual sampling and laboratory analysis are the traditional methods for monitoring soil conditions and nutrient levels, but they can be time-consuming and expensive, and may not give real-time data. Agricultural settings require accurate and timely information about soil conditions and nutrient levels, which is a challenge with soil conditions and nutrient monitoring. Farmers who are unable to obtain the weather details may face losses in farming, which is why it is crucial to understand weather forecasting in a timely manner. Farmers should obtain adequate information about soil and crop details to enhance crop productivity.We are working to address some of the challenges farmers encounter. 

### How can technology help?

Our proposed solution will help the farmer in all aspects, including monitoring nutrients and soil conditions. The data obtained from the monitoring system will be archived on a cloud server for evaluation. The main goal is to keep track of the level of nutrients in the soil. Various sensors will be used to monitor parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, temperature, and pH value in our proposed system. Farmers will be able to accurately plan cultivation by knowing their soil before starting farming. The sensor data has been incorporated into our website. The soil analysis feature on our website allows for the display of results for various parameters and the visualization of the analyzed data. There is also a section designed to educate farmers. Details about the importance of these parameters are provided in that section, and we will also provide crop information to enhance productivity. The forecasting section is where they will receive the five-day weather forecast in advance. 

### The idea

Developing and deploying low-cost, low-power, quicker, and real-time soil conditions and nutrients monitoring systems in farm lands For this, sensor nodes are developed by incorporating major soil nutrients and conditions sensors and ESP-32. This embedded system uploads the soil nutrients and conditions data to the IoT cloud over Wi-Fi protocol. The data from the cloud is fetched using an API, and using JavaScript, the data is analysed and displayed on our website.

## The architecture

![Data Flow]()

1. ESP-32 from SoilConnect sensor node reads the sensor readings. 
2. It will send the readings through MQTT Protocol to IoT Cloud
3. Using API it delivers the contents from IoT Cloud to website and processed
5. A Dashboard is created to visualize realtime data.

## Long description

[More detail is available here](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md)

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.
- Sense Major nutrients and conditions.
- Sent readings seperatly to IoT cloud.
- Display Realtime data at Webendpoint
- Provide API to fetch Realtime and historical data.
