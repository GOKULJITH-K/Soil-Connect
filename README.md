## Short description

### What's the problem?

Soil conditions and nutrients monitoring using the cloud is a project aimed at enhancing soil health and crop productivity. Traditional methods of monitoring
soil conditions and nutrient levels involve manual sampling and laboratory analysis,which can be time consuming and expensive and may not provide real time data. The
challenge with soil conditions and nutrient monitoring is the need for accurate and timely information on soil conditions and nutrient levels in agricultural settings.

### How can technology help?

Our proposed solution will help the farmer in all aspects, which involve the monitoring of nutrients and conditions in the soil. The data collected from the mon-
itoring station will be stored in a cloud server for analysis. The main purpose is to monitor the level of nutrients in the soil. Also our proposed system will monitor
the parameters like nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, temperature, pH value using various sensors. This will help a farmer to know his soil before starting farming and
precisely plan cultivation.
### The idea

Developing and deploying low cost, low power, quicker, and real time soil conditions and nutrients monitoring system at pollution affected area. For this, array sensor nodes are developed by incorporating major air nutrients and conditions sensors and NodeMCU.  This embedded system uploads the soil nutrients and conditions data to the IBM Watson IoT cloud over Wi-Fi protocol.

## The architecture

![Single Node Data flow](./docs/images/Block-Diagram---Github.jpg)

1. ESP-32 from SoilConnect sensor node reads the sensor readings. 
2. It will send the readings through MQTT Protocol to IBM Watson IOT
3. Using Node Red Flows the readings are fetched from IBM Watson IOT and Stored it into IBM Cloudant DB
4. A public API Endpoint is made using Fast API, It processes and delivers the contents from Cloudant DB to Apps
5. A Dashboard is created to visualize realtime data.

## Long description

[More detail is available here](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md)

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.
- Sense Major nutrients and conditions.
- Sent readings seperatly to IBM Watson IOT cloud.
- Display Realtime data at Webendpoint
- Provide API to fetch Realtime and historical data.
